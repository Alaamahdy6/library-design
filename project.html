				<h2>type of books </h2>
				<p> When it comes to a selecting a great book, we don't discriminate here at saturn.com. From an essential fall best-seller, to novels by Latinx authors, and every single read on saturn's Book Club list, our approach to finding a riveting page-turner is to have an open mind.</p>

					<h3>Action and Adventure</h3>
					<p>Action and adventure books constantly have you on the edge of your seat with excitement, as your fave main character repeatedly finds themselves in high stakes situations. The protagonist has an ultimate goal to achieve and is always put in risky, often dangerous situations. This genre typically crosses over with others like mystery, crime </p>
					</div>
					<div>
					<h3>Classics</h3>
					<p>you may think of these books as the throwback readings you were assigned in English class. The classics have been around for decades, and were often groundbreaking stories at their publish time, but have continued to be impactful for generations, serving as the foundation for many popular works we read today.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					<h3>Comic Book or Graphic Novel</h3>
					<p>The stories in comic books and graphic novels are presented to the reader through engaging, sequential narrative art (illustrations and typography) that's either presented in a specific design or the traditional panel layout you find in comics. With both, you'll often find the dialogue presented in the tell-tale "word balloons" next to the respective characters.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					<h3>Detective and Mystery</h3>
					<p>The plot always revolves around a crime of sorts that must be solved—or foiled—by the protagonists.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					<h3>Historical Fiction</h3>
					<p>These books are based in a time period set in the past decades, often against the backdrop of significant (real) historical events</p>
